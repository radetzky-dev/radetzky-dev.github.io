        <h2>Gastronomy</h2>
        <p>The quality of Extremaduran food arises from the fine quality of the local
            ingredients. In addition to free-range lamb and beef, fabulous cheeses, red and
            white wines, olive oil, honey and paprika, Extremadura is particularly renowned for
            Iberian ham. The 'pata negra' (blackfoot) pigs are fed on acorns in the cork-oak
            forests, the key to producing the world's best ham and cured sausages.</p>
